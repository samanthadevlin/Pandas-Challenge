In general the first observation I made is that the "male" gender is the highest number of players. 
The gender of "male" makes the most purchases of an average price os $3.00 per item and a total of $1900.00 per individual person.
The average age of most players is between 20-30, with the most players in the age group of 25-30. 
Based on the information prodivded we can conclude that the "male" gender makes up for most players, purchases for the game.
